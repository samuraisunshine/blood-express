SCI-FI MYSTIC HORROR TALE: THE CALL OF THE VOID

CHAPTER 1: THE FIND

For thousands of years, humanity's cosmic land grab didn't just open doors to progress and freedom—it also left behind a graveyard of lost colonies, their dusty ruins packed with the treasures of long-gone pioneers. Those were the kind of spots the scrappy little starship Aurora 570 and its tight-knit crew had been chasing for years, scavenging for valuable relics of the past. Colony ID8773 was the next link in their never-ending chain of expeditions, its coordinates dug up from ancient archives by the crew's go-to archaeologist, nicknamed Shovel.

Nobody knew his real name, and frankly, nobody cared. What mattered was his knack for sniffing out the kind of place that'd make the crew some serious coin. Shovel was a pro at that. Maybe that's why they called him Shovel—or maybe it was because he never parted with a beat-up pre-colonization sapper's spade, polished to a mirror shine. No spring chicken, with sharp blue eyes, classic suspenders, and a khaki shirt, Shovel buffed his prize possession daily, sparking a fresh round of crew ribbing. But nobody dared poke fun to his face. Not because he was some delicate flower—hell, he could dish it out and make it hurt—but because losing a guy like him would be like tossing gold out the airlock. Good archaeologists, even the useless ones, were worth their weight in credits.

Humanity, in its frenzy, had spawned so many colonies that keeping track of them all was a pipe dream. Any schmuck with enough credits could rent a shuttle, slap on a life-support module, and blast off with their family to some far-flung corner of the cosmos, no return ticket required. If space had an edge, human ambition sure didn't. So, data on countless colonies was either classified, locked away on some lone ship's drive, or—more often than not—just plain lost.

ID8773 was a fluke find for Shovel, but it grabbed him by the throat. The payoff promised to be huge—this was a first-wave colony, meaning if it hadn't been picked clean, it was likely stuffed with ancient, high-value gear. Like that sapper's spade of his. Shovel was all about the loot, and to be fair, so was the rest of the crew. That's what glued them together on the Aurora 570. The only thing holding them back was the size of the ship's cargo hold.

	- Attention, we're closing in on the target! - Captain Vainowski's gravelly voice crackled over the comms, jolting navigator Keri awake.
Young but already making waves in certain circles, Keri was itching for action. It was her turn for the away mission, so her sleep was light—she was too damn curious about adventures and mysteries for deep shut-eye. Not that digs were always a blast; most times, they'd find a colony already looted to hell and back. But Keri's gut was screaming that this one would be different. She’d even asked the captain if she could bring a blaster, not that he’d ever said yes. Her youth was one of Vainowski’s main gripes, but he rarely handed out weapons for away missions. No need. Wild colonies were built on planets or moons with no life to speak of. The only real requirement for a half-decent settlement was Earth-like gravity. Everything else boiled down to startup cash. So, no mowing down hordes of local critters—or plants, for that matter. The colonies were already dead. The worst you’d run into was other black archaeologists, but the unwritten code of the trade was clear: finders keepers, and most stuck to it. Sure, there were rare cases of shadier scavengers ripping off their own kind, but that’s where Steve came in.

A mountain of muscle with biceps ready to burst, silent but fair, Steve was loyal only to the captain. His job? Security—whether from outside threats or trouble within. The crew had their spats, but one look from Steve was enough to shut them down. A gnarly scar slashed across his face, impossible to miss. He never spilled the beans on where it came from, though at drunken gatherings, he’d spin wild tales, each one different. Maybe one was true, but only Steve knew for sure. And maybe the captain.

Colony ID8773 looked like most of the places they’d cleaned out: standard living modules, a comms tower, a landing pad, and holes punched through by micrometeoroids since the shields went offline. A sad yet tempting sight.

The away team was set by a rotating schedule, ensuring at least three stayed on the ship. Shovel went on every mission—his job demanded it, and he loved it. His work was his passion. Not everyone shared that vibe, though. Take Warrenston, the medic. He wasn’t thrilled about rummaging through old junk; he’d rather be stitching up a pile of guts, though that had never happened. As he suited up, he muttered under his breath, his grumbling laced with the occasional classy curse. Warrenston was a recent addition, roped in by chance after patching up the cook Sam’s hand, sliced up by his own clumsiness. The captain had been hunting for a ship’s medic for ages, even keeping a cabin free—though it was crammed with junk until Warrenston showed up. Something about him clicked with Vainowski. Stars aligned, and Warrenston signed on quick, maybe because his old gig was dull as dishwater, or maybe for the thrill and profit. He claimed a wife was waiting for him on the other side of the galaxy, but nobody bought it. Nobody could stand him for more than thirty minutes. The crew couldn’t fathom anyone marrying such a bore. Sometimes, you could feel the question hanging in the air: why the hell did Vainowski pick him? The captain just stared back with a sly grin. Vainowski wasn’t always an open book, but his choices always panned out. So, nobody hassled the space pirate. Questioning your captain was bad form—you either trusted him or got kicked off at the next outpost.

This time, the away team was Keri, Warrenston, Shovel, and the captain’s right-hand man, Gabriel—a wiry guy with beady, cunning eyes and a wispy mustache. Nobody felt safe around him. He didn’t give any obvious reason to worry, but something in his face, his movements, his voice screamed “slippery snake.” And yet, his cut of the loot was second only to the captain’s, despite doing jack squat.

	- "Not exactly a dream team," Keri thought, gearing up for the mission, "but whatever. A few more runs like this, and I’ll have my own rustbucket ship. Maybe I’ll even poach Shovel for my crew."
Keri had dreamed of her own ship forever. That dream was fueled by a burning need to track down her missing father, etched in her memory as a young, dashing captain of a Class-C warship. He’d vanished on a mission, and the government’s payout only covered her flight academy tuition. She never knew her mother, but her father always spoke of her warmly.

Eager to hit the jackpot, Keri clenched her fists and stepped out of the airlock. ID8773 sat on a moon orbiting a massive planet, with no atmosphere to speak of. The view hit Keri like a punch: a breathtaking yet familiar mix of star clusters and ancient ruins, framed by a giant red planet creeping over the horizon, painting the abandoned buildings and empty plains first pink, then blood-red. It made her head spin and her mouth taste like salt. A strange jitter ran through her. Despite her youth, Keri had seen her share of space travel and relic hunting, but something about this colony felt off. She couldn’t pin it down. Five-hundred-year-old corpses didn’t faze her anymore, and ruins were practically her second home. But something weird hung in the air, and the away team’s lineup wasn’t helping her shake the unease. The red glints on their mirrored visors only made it worse.

	- Keri, quit spacing out! - Gabriel’s nasal voice snapped her back to reality.
She didn’t bother replying, just strode toward the modules, stepping over tattered suits with the bones of long-dead settlers inside. What wiped out this colony? An epidemic? Mass insanity? The latter seemed more likely. Humanity’s wild expansion was unmatched, but it was a chaotic mess. Nobody bothered checking the sanity of would-be colonists. Got credits? Here’s a module—do whatever the hell you want. Most of these places went off the deep end.

	- "Just don’t lose it yourself," Keri thought, nearing a residential module—or rather, a dead module, as the Aurora crew and other black archaeologists jokingly called them.
	- Alright, don’t wander too far, and report any finds immediately! - Vainowski’s voice crackled over the radio.
	- Wander? There’s only ten compartments here. What the hell are we even doing in this backwater? - Warrenston, true to form, was whining again.
	- Doc, save it for later. This red planet’s creepy enough as it is, - Shovel’s soft voice calmed Keri a bit, knowing she wasn’t the only one feeling off. - Maybe they dug a little deeper here.
As he spoke, the archaeologist fondly patted his spade, dangling cheerfully from his suit. They got lucky— the colony was untouched, with dust blanketing everything inside. The pragmatic Gabriel headed straight for the storage rooms, Shovel whistled a simple tune while scanning the area and prepping a portable vacuum, and Warrenston just kept an eye on everyone else.

Keri, driven by a nagging unease, wandered into a spacious rec room. Her flashlight beam slid over ancient entertainment gear—mostly gaming machines, treadmills, and weights to stay in shape even on the galaxy’s fringes. But even those couldn’t save this place from ruin. Keri was about to call it quits— this junk wouldn’t fetch much on the market—when her eyes caught something odd for a place like this: a strange vessel, about the size of a head, with two sharp handles. Dust barely clung to it, revealing its red-and-black color. Something pricked at Keri’s chest, and just then, Vainowski’s gleeful voice blared through her helmet’s speakers.

	- Guys! Jackpot! These idiots hauled a real damn piano out here! Man, I’ve never seen one of these in person! Captain, send down Buddy!
Buddy was their unofficial eighth crew member—a levitating cargo platform with a goofy smiley face on its front panel. Keri had caught hell for that stunt, but nobody bothered to wipe off the smiley. No successful mission went without their trusty pal.

	- Gabriel, you son of a bitch, don’t you dare touch it! - Shovel growled and bolted after the assistant.
When Keri returned from the rec room, Buddy zoomed in, lights blinking merrily, spinning clumsily without knocking anything over, kicking up a bit of dust, and vanishing down the dark corridor toward the storage rooms. Keri wandered the colony some more. It seemed like just another fallen outpost, but something intangible kept her on edge. That damn vessel wouldn’t leave her mind. The team’s bickering over how to transport such a rare find buzzed in her ears, with Warrenston, of course, chiming in that there used to be a whole profession for moving pianos pre-colonization. Then the massive instrument floated out of storage, with tireless Buddy humming beneath it. Gabriel, the captain’s assistant, trailed behind, looking pleased.

	- "Probably pleased," Keri thought, watching them go, since his visor was just a void of black.
The finder got a bigger cut of the haul. Meanwhile, Shovel was wrapping up his sweep.

	- Alright, nothing else to do here. That piano’s worth as much as a spaceship these days.
	- "Ugh, a ship…" Keri thought, feeling that familiar pang again.
She blinked and realized she was staring back at the rec room, even though she’d just been watching Gabriel rummage through junk.

	- "What the hell…" Curiosity was getting the better of her. Sure, a piano was a rare find, but that weird vessel— "It doesn’t belong here," she decided, heading back to the rec room.
	- Keri, forget something? - Shovel sometimes played the caring dad, but not so much it got annoying.
	- Nah, nothing big, I’ll be quick, - Keri said, already reaching for the strange vessel, which looked more like a burial urn.
It wasn’t heavy, but not light either, and she could’ve sworn it felt cold when she picked it up.

	- "God, what am I doing…"
	- What are you still doing there? Get your ass back to the ship! - Vainowski cut in, well aware of his youngest crew member’s knack for chasing oddities and nonsense.
	- Yes, sir! On my way! - Keri replied with exaggerated snap, deliberately taking her time toward the exit.
	- "Hope this jug’s worth something," Keri thought.
Each step echoed in her body, every meter toward the exit felt a bit heavier. That imaginary cold she’d conjured up seemed to grow colder still.

Shovel was waiting by the ship.

	- Come on, move it, we’re leaving! Wait, what’s that you got?
	- Just a trinket, a memento of another testament to humanity’s downfall.
	- What’s with the melancholy all of a sudden?
Keri was a bit surprised by her own reply. The fully risen red planet bathed everything in crimson. Only the ship’s entrance glowed white, like the one good spot in this godforsaken place. Like a gateway to paradise. But the growing dread wouldn’t let Keri rest.

	- "Oh, come on!" she snapped at herself, vanishing into the light of the closing airlock.
The ship’s engines roared, kicking up everything on the landing pad—abandoned gear, brittle human remains. It all floated, stained redder still. Sound doesn’t travel in a vacuum, but through the hull, the whole crew felt the rising symphony of their ascent into the endless black of space.

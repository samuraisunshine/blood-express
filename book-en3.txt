SCI-FI MYSTIC HORROR TALE: THE CALL OF THE VOID

CHAPTER 2: THROUGH THE ABYSS

	Space travel takes some time. The duration of each jump doesn't depend on how far your destination is—the key factor is the navigator's sharpness. The technology for warping space is still not fully understood, just like gravity's explanation lagged until the expansion era. So, every jump is a mix of clever calculations and intuition. Keri wasn't big on experience yet, but the young girl had intuition in spades. That's why the Aurora 570's jumps could take an unexpectedly long time. The ship's cook, Sam, even set up a little gambling ring with Steve and Warrenston. Before each warp, they'd guess the number of hours, and the closest one would score a little profit off the others. Vainowski didn't approve of gambling, but he turned a blind eye to these antics.

	The flight from ID8773 to the last stop of the expedition took an outrageous week instead of the usual two or three days. Even seasoned spacefarers get tired of long hauls, and the only one not grumbling was security guy Steve—he'd bet on the longest time.

	Keri was preparing for the jump after that horrible dream. She was wrecked and anxious. The blood drop flying into the urn wouldn't leave her head, and though nothing really happened, the circumstances and the nightmare left her no chance to keep her cool. On the way to the bridge, she bumped into Gabriel. She really wanted to know what he wanted yesterday and what he saw, but he avoided eye contact, mumbled a greeting, and slipped past like lightning, vanishing around the corridor bend. "Screw him, not like I care that much," Keri thought, trudging wearily to the ship's nose, where the controls and command station were. Gabriel disgusted Keri, and it all started when he tried to hit on her after their first joint expedition. He didn't get hints about rejection and kept pushing for "friendly" relations. Though there was nothing friendly about it. Youth and looks attract the opposite sex anyway, and the rest of the crew sent signals for getting closer in one way or another. But Gabriel had to have a serious talk with Steve, after which the crude hints and bad jokes from the first mate noticeably dropped.

	- A week?? - The captain was as pissed as the rest. - Keri, I specifically let you sleep in!

	- Sorry, sir… - she said, staring guiltily off to the side, gently scuffing her slipper toe back and forth on the floor.

	- Again with your crap! So what happened?

	- Nothing much, sir… just a nightmare. - And those images surfaced again, making Keri shudder involuntarily.

	- Yeah… Sure… - The girl's natural charm and a bit of acting broke the captain's attempt at discipline. - And next time you pick something up on a mission, you report it to me, not Shovel. Preferably before it gets on the ship.

	- Yes, I know, sir…

	- Why'd you even need that thing? Channel your energy into studying jumps instead, or we'll never make it to base…

	The captain's speech was interrupted by a signal automatically intercepted by the ship's systems. "...Mayday… Mayday… To anyone listening…" the receiver came to life and then went silent again. Keri and Vainowski exchanged silent looks; the captain shrugged. Signals caught during a jump usually came from the area they jumped from. But the time when they were sent could range from days to centuries. The quirks of space warping for fast travel led to some weird phenomena. Scientists had mastered jumps enough for stable results, but they never broke through that invisible barrier hiding the mechanics of warping. The result overshadowed the mystery with the vastness of the universe and its exploration. In the end, adventurers were plenty, scientists – zero.

	"...We're dealing with something unimaginable!..." - some voice crackled through the speaker again.

	- Intriguing. - the captain said casually. The girl, however, was hooked on the message and started tweaking the receiver's rubber knobs to get a more stable signal. The receiver panel, grateful for the touch, blinked its lights happily, and the speaker spat out the next chunk of signal – "...the whole crew's scared… We can barely sleep because of these stupid nightmares… Or maybe it's not a dream? David?..."

	"The Call of the Void," that's what spacefarers called these intercepts. The poetic name gave the phenomenon charm, but in practice, it was pretty useless. The sender was likely long dead, and the message was more of a tradition in dire straits. The Call could be compared to cosmic radio, as cold and merciless, ready to kill you for the slightest slip-up.

	"...Fuck, why did we take that thing… David, what are you doing?... I keep feeling like these shadows are growing…"

	Keri turned to the captain and caught him frozen with his mouth open, eyes drilling some distant, nonexistent point.

	- Cap?.. - Keri said cautiously.

	With the same expression, the captain's head slowly turned toward the girl, and when it turned enough, his glazed eyes looked not at her, but through her. Keri yelped and wanted to call the captain again, louder, but the next moment she realized she was staring like an idiot at Vainowski, who was quietly shuffling papers.

	"...always these eyes in the dark… I see them moving, I see!... David, no!..."

	- This is from around where we were, right? - Keri's voice sounded like crumpled paper. Sweat beaded on her forehead. It didn't take a genius to put two and two together; Keri recalled the vessel again, and her anxiety surged even stronger.

	- Kid, what's up with you? - Gabriel boldened a bit. - Scared of ghosts from the past?

	His tone, and his voice in general, snapped her out of it. She had to respond, couldn't let that jerk's jab slide. But the lingering anxiety didn't fade completely; it messed with her thinking, and the captain wasn't rushing to help, buried in his captain's duties. Spitting out something like "I eat those ghosts for breakfast," she hurried out of the bridge. "I'll find out later what David did," she thought on the way to the galley. The best remedy for blues on long hauls – Sam's cooking and jokes. Except this time, she'd be the butt of the jokes for that stupid jump. Realizing that, she turned toward her cabin. On the way, she ran into Warrenston.

	- Sweetie, you're pale! Is it from the intercept? - The medic's job included keeping the crew in tip-top shape. - Feeling okay?

	- I'm fine, doc… Just didn't sleep well. - Talking to Warrenston didn't promise anything pleasant either. - Don't worry, I'll crash and be good as new.

	- Yeah, yeah… I'll log that in my journal. Expect you in medbay in eight hours. - The boring medic's attempts at humor didn't even look like attempts. He laughed loudly himself and shuffled off, humming a simple tune with "journaaal, journal." Keri was left confused. "What the hell journal?" she thought. "After these idiots, I'll need a longer vacation…"

	Space travel is a pretty boring affair. On sea voyages, you could at least step out on deck, breathe fresh air, hear seagulls squawking, and enjoy the sun. At least that's what old books said. In space, there was nothing like that—just black infinity everywhere, and stepping out meant cold oblivion. With each step, the corridor walls seemed to narrow, the bundles of main cables, uncovered by paneling, twisted tighter in her peripheral vision. Her head buzzed from the piling events, and her appetite was gone. Keri remembered her father's face from one of the two remaining photos. "Dad would've handled it all… I'll handle it too," she thought, entering her cabin.

	"...Aaa… Eyes!.. they're moving, I see!... David, no!..."

	- Screw this! - the girl yelled and flipped the intercept relay switch. - This time, I'll ask for a longer vacation.

	Her voice echoed in the spacious cabin. Space is infinite, so why should ship cabins be cramped? That's the main principle of the new, spread-out humanity. Everyone could build their own Eden, but for each, it could become their own grave. "Rest in peace, ancestors… And you too, David…" - with those thoughts, Keri started her daily workout, hoping the sweat would wash away all her anxieties and guesses.

Chapter 3. Through the Abyss

	Space travel takes time, and the length of a jump doesn’t depend on how far the destination is but on the navigator’s intuition. The technology of space warping remains partly unexplained, just like gravity was a mystery until the expansion era. So every jump is a mix of clever calculations and gut feeling. While Keri lacked experience, her intuition was unmatched. This made Aurora 570’s jumps unpredictable in duration. The ship’s cook Sam even started a small betting pool with Steve and Warrenson, guessing the hours of each jump, and the closest bet earned a small profit. Vainowski didn’t approve of gambling but turned a blind eye to such antics.

	The flight from ID8773 to the expedition’s final stop took an unforgivable week instead of the usual two or three days. Even seasoned spacefarers grew tired of long trips, and the only one not grumbling was Steve, the guard, who bet on the longest duration.

	Keri was preparing for the jump after that horrific dream. She felt shattered and anxious. The image of a drop of blood falling into the urn haunted her, and though nothing major happened, the circumstances and the nightmare left her struggling to stay composed. On her way to the bridge, she ran into Gabriel. She desperately wanted to know what he was after yesterday and what he saw, but he avoided eye contact, muttered a greeting, and slipped away around a corridor bend. Хрен с тобой, не особо то и хотелось, Keri thought, trudging wearily to the ship’s nose, where the control room and command station were. Gabriel disgusted her, ever since he started hitting on her after their first joint expedition. He didn’t take hints well and kept pushing for friendly relations, though there was nothing friendly about it. Youth and good looks inevitably drew attention, and the rest of the crew sent signals of interest in their own ways. But Gabriel had a serious talk with Steve, which noticeably cut down his crude remarks and bad jokes.

	- A week?? - The captain was as frustrated as the rest. - Keri, I gave you time to rest up!
	- Sorry, sir… - she said, guiltily staring aside, shuffling her slipper’s toe back and forth on the floor.
	- Those tricks of yours again! So what’s wrong?
	- Nothing serious, just a nightmare. - The images flooded back, making Keri shudder involuntarily.
	- Yeah, sure… - Her natural charm and a bit of acting broke the captain’s attempt to lecture her. - Also, when you pick something up on a mission, you need to report it, not Shovel. Preferably before it gets on the ship.
	- Yes, I understand, sir…
	- Why did you even take it? Focus your energy on studying jumps, or we’ll never reach the base…

	The captain’s speech was cut off by a signal intercepted by the ship’s systems. …Мэйдэй… Мэйдэй… Всем кто слышит… The receiver crackled to life and fell silent again. Keri and Vainowski exchanged a silent glance; the captain shrugged. Signals received during a jump usually came from the area where the jump started, but their timing could range from days to centuries ago. The quirks of space warping for fast travel led to strange phenomena. Scientists had mastered jumps to a stable enough level but never broke through the invisible barrier hiding the secrets of warp mechanics. The results overshadowed the mystery, with the vast universe and its exploration eclipsing further study. In the end, adventurers abounded, while scientists were nowhere to be found.

	…У нас творится что-то невообразимое!... A hoarse voice broke through the speaker again.
	- Intriguing. - the captain said casually. Keri, however, was gripped by the message and began tweaking the receiver’s rubber knobs for a clearer signal. The panel responded eagerly, its lights blinking cheerfully, and the speaker delivered the next fragment: …вчера погиб Джон, это уже вторая смерть за эту неделю…
	“Зов Бездны”, so they called these intercepts in wide circles. The poetic name gave the phenomenon a certain charm, but in truth, it was of little use. The sender was likely long dead, and the message was more a tradition born of dire situations. The Call could be compared to cosmic radio, just as cold and cruel, ready to kill you for the slightest mistake.
	…вся команда перепугана… Нам сложно спать из-за этих дурацких кошмаров… А может быть это не сон? Дэвид?...
	“Зов Бездны” was something every spacefarer listened to. Nothing fueled the will to live in the grim voids like someone else’s inevitable demise. The most gripping messages were recorded and even published in an annual almanac of the same name. The cosmic wave switch was always on aboard Aurora.
	…Кэвин спятил и пытался разрезать себе брюхо, говорит у него там зло внутри… - the intercept grew more dizzying and was sure to make it into that almanac.
	- So, never felt like… ahem… checking out? - Gabriel’s detached voice scalded Keri; the captain didn’t flinch.
	- Sneak up like that again, and I’ll definitely help you with that. - Keri said tensely. She glared at him, but he quickly looked away. Что с ним происходит? Может это из-за вчерашнего? - usually, the first mate acted far more brazen, especially without Steve around. In the bridge, he’d act like the king’s deputy, but not this time. Nor afterward.
	… - the speaker’s hiss grew louder, along with the anxiety brewing since morning.
	…Нахрен мы взяли эту штуковину… Дэвид, что ты делаешь?... Мне постоянно кажется, что эти тени вокруг нарастают…
	Keri turned to the captain and found him frozen, mouth agape, eyes boring into some distant, nonexistent point.
	- Cap?.. - Keri said cautiously.
	With the same expression, the captain’s head slowly turned toward her, but when it faced her, his glassy eyes looked through her. Keri gasped and wanted to call out again, louder, but then realized she was staring like an idiot at Vainowski, quietly shuffling through papers.
	…постоянно эти глаза во мраке… Я уже не понимаю я сплю или нет… Дэвид, черт тебя дери, что ты делаешь?...
	- Isn’t that from around where we were? - Keri’s voice sounded like crumpled paper. Sweat beaded on her forehead. It didn’t take a genius to put two and two together; Keri thought of the urn again, and her anxiety surged.
	- What’s wrong, kid? - Gabriel grew bolder. - Scared of ghosts from the past?
	His tone, his voice, snapped her out of it. She had to say something, couldn’t let this jerk get away with it. But the lingering anxiety muddled her thoughts, and the captain, buried in his duties, wasn’t helping. Muttering something like Я этих призраков на завтрак ем, she rushed out of the bridge. Потом узнаю, что там Дэвид наделал, she thought, heading to the galley. The best cure for the blues on long hauls was Sam’s cooking and jokes. But this time, she’d likely be the butt of those jokes because of the botched jump. Realizing this, she veered toward her cabin. On the way, she ran into Warrenson.
	- Darling, you’re pale! Is it the intercept? - The medic’s job was to keep the crew in shape. - Feeling okay?
	- I’m fine, doc, just didn’t sleep well. - Talking to Warrenson promised nothing pleasant. - Don’t worry, I’ll catch up on sleep, and I’ll be fine.
	- Uh-huh, uh-huh… I’ll note that in my journal. I expect you in the medbay in eight hours. - The stuffy medic’s attempts at humor barely passed as such. He laughed loudly, humming a simple tune with the words журнааал, журнал, and walked off, leaving Keri rattled. Какой еще нахрен журнал? - Keri thought. - После этих идиотов мне потребуется отпуск…
	Space travel was a dull affair. Old books said sea voyages let you step onto the deck, breathe fresh air, hear seagulls, and enjoy the sun. Space offered none of that—just black infinity everywhere, and stepping out meant cold oblivion. With each step, the corridor walls seemed to close in, the exposed bundles of wires twisting tighter in her peripheral vision. Her head buzzed from the day’s events, and her appetite was gone. Keri recalled her father’s face from one of her two remaining photos. Папа бы все выдержал… выдержу и я, she thought, entering her cabin.
	…Аааа… Глаза!.. они двигаются, я вижу!... Дэвид, нет!...
	- To hell with it! - Keri shouted, flipping the intercept relay’s switch. - This time, I’m asking for a longer vacation.
	Her voice echoed in the spacious cabin. Space is infinite, so why should ship cabins be cramped? That was the core principle of humanity, now spread across the cosmos. Everyone could build their own Eden, but it could also become their grave. Покойтесь же с миром, предки… И ты, Дэвид, тоже… - With these thoughts, Keri started her daily workout, hoping sweat would wash away her fears and suspicions.

	***

	The week-long jump felt like eternity. Everyone fought boredom in their own way. Sam, for instance, went back to his old tricks, cooking an indescribable but surprisingly tasty mush. He loved watching faces shift from disgust to bliss, eyes rolling back in pleasure. Steve read and trained, then read again, offering lessons to whoever wanted them. Keri visited him most often; her young body bent and took on the strain more eagerly. That week, she trained even more, trying to quiet the incidents haunting her mind.
	The crew’s negativity about her miscalculated jump faded by the third day. The jokes and jabs died down, but Keri felt no relief. By the fourth day, she admitted something in her perception had shifted—for the worse. It was like a thin veil separating her from everything else. All she knew and saw seemed duller, despite the captain’s rolled-back eyes during meals. She couldn’t do the same; something was missing. That damned urn kept creeping into her thoughts. Keri even impulsively locked the cabinet with the strange find, and for a moment, it felt like a weight lifted. But the relief was short-lived, and the cosmos through the porthole looked less black than before.
	Keri kept running into Gabriel loitering near her cabin. He avoided contact, pretending to be busy with something important. When she asked directly, Гэб, чего тебе надо?, he mumbled about routine ship checks or similar nonsense. Yet he was drawn to her cabin like a magnet. It didn’t take much to put two and two together. Keri knew it was about the urn and what happened, but she had no proof to confront the first mate, and she didn’t want to raise suspicions with the captain. Nor did she want to mention the prick and its circumstances.
	She visited Warrenson for a checkup. The medic, ever attentive to the crew’s condition, noticed something was off with Keri.
	- How’d you get that? - His tone was as dull and flat as always. Keri’s heart skipped, but she didn’t let it show.
	- Don’t know…
	- What do you mean, don’t know? How do you not notice a prick?
	- Maybe I just snagged it…
	- Where? When?
	- Doc, I don’t know, why are you hounding me?
	Grumbling, the medic noted the checkup in Keri’s file, mentioning only elevated blood pressure and pale skin. Handing her a pack of vitamins and some hemoglobin, he calmed down and buried himself in the perfectly organized files in the medbay. Annoyingly meticulous order. For some reason, it irritated Keri more than usual, and she slipped out quickly. To distract herself, she went to the control room, where the captain was, as usual, doing calculations. He doubled as the accountant since no one else wanted the job. She didn’t want to disturb him, nor did she feel like talking, so she sat at the navigation equipment and started plotting preliminary calculations for the next jump. It helped ease her irritation a bit, and the photo of her young, smiling father, stuck to the panel with gum, brought back fond memories of days when he carried her on his strong shoulders. A tear rolled down Keri’s cheek.

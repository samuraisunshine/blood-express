SCI-FI MYSTIC HORROR TALE: THE CALL OF THE VOID

CHAPTER 2: AWAKENING

	The crew mostly talked in three situations: over the intercom, which had two modes—general chat and private calls; during away missions; and at the dinner table. You didn’t see much in the way of tight friendships or epic romances in crews like this. Everyone knew what they were after in this mess they’d gotten themselves into, so they didn’t waste time on pointless chitchat. The expedition gig wasn’t exactly legal, either. Everything black archaeologists dug up in space got fenced on the same black market, far from the prying eyes of law enforcement.

	- So, do you guys even get what we scored? - Shovel asked smugly during the next meal after ID8773.

	- Oh, sure, sure, - Warrenston perked up, prompting tired glances from the rest of the crew. - A pre-expansion musical instrument, big hit with the rich folks back in the day. The name says it all—royal, from old English!

	- Oh, God… - Steve the security guy muttered under his breath.

	- Is he for real? - Sam the cook and Gabriel whispered to each other.

	Despite its clunky flaws, the Galactic Union, paired with modern tech, provided a solid education system. Classroom learning came with info injections straight to the brain. Data uploads were practically routine, limited only by each person’s natural aptitude. Warrenston clearly had the knack for it, but the sheer volume of data he’d crammed in seemed to have scrambled him a bit. That was the one topic the medic refused to touch in conversation. Most of what he “knew,” everyone else knew too, and this was no exception.

	- Warren, you done showing off? - Shovel’s wrinkled face got a touch older and craggier. The medic rolled his eyes and went back to scarfing down spaghetti, the crew’s favorite post-mission meal. - Point is, this ain’t just any piano. It’s a rare model, and in damn good shape. I’m pretty sure once we sell it, we can each take a year-long vacation. With cash to spare!

	The Aurora 570 crew perked up. Amid restrained and deliberately goofy cheers, Keri caught an odd glint in Gabriel’s eyes. After all, the one who found the treasure got a bigger cut. That tradition went back to when all of humanity was crammed onto one tiny planet. But even though the news was a thrill, nobody started dancing on the table. Shovel’s predictions didn’t always pan out.

	- So, what? Should I whip up a cake for tomorrow? - Sam boomed, the heart and soul of the crew. The cook was the only one who kept friendly ties with everyone. Last time, he made a cake out of cloned liver, which somehow brought the team closer—mostly in shared confusion over his taste.

	- Nah, make waffles instead! - Keri blurted out, almost hysterically. She was still too young for those culinary experiments, and the memory of that cake was fresh.

	The mess hall erupted in laughter.

	Driven by her thirst for adventure and her search for her father, Keri was easy on the eyes, and her youth drew looks whether she liked it or not. Not that she dressed flashy—more like work gear. That, plus her fiery attitude, made her a tough cookie, which kept most of the guys at bay.

	- Alright, later, losers! - Keri tossed out as she left, feeling nearly every pair of eyes on her. Meanwhile, Shovel was lovingly stroking his spade.

	Before she was even out of earshot, the guys started their dumb, macho jokes. Whatever—Steve was there to keep things in line. Plus, without Keri, the ship would burn through four times the fuel for jumps. A valuable crewmate was always handy for hunting lost treasures.

	Reaching her cabin, Keri found a sticker on the door that read “CALL ME” in Shovel’s handwriting. “When did he stick this here?” she thought, yanking it off. It had been covering the face scanner, which beeped and slid the doors open with a sultry hiss. Wisps of vapor curled under the threshold, giving the scene an extra sci-fi vibe. Keri’s boots sliced through the mist as she headed straight for the shower.

	Under the hot water, that jug—or maybe urn—kept creeping into her mind. Some colonies used similar vessels to store the ashes of loved ones, and it wasn’t exactly rare. Crematoriums often doubled as trash incinerators. Nobody batted an eye—under the weight of expansion, old-world religions had crumbled, and events took on a mythical edge. Humanity’s spread was as predictable as it was chaotic, like a wild climax. Plenty of folks quietly wondered, “What was the point of all this?” Well, everyone chose whether to live or die out in the endless void. Many survived, adapting to these weekend world-swaps just because there was an ocean and sand. But you’d better steer clear of the ocean.

	This urn, though, sparked something special in Keri. She recalled the strange golden patterns on black stone and that single red dot woven into the intricate gold. The moment she thought of the dot, a pang hit her chest, and a fading word—“come”—lingered in her mind. A second that felt like half an hour later, Keri flinched at the sharp beep warning her water was running low. The flickering bulb’s ghostly reflections danced across her skin.

	Half-dried, Keri flopped into her work chair and, remembering the note, called Shovel.

	- Did you tell the captain about your find? - Shovel’s voice crackled through the speaker above her desk after a short wait. - Whatever, I did it for you. If it weren’t for the big score, you’d be in hot water already.

	- Come on, what’s the big deal? Maybe my find’s even bigger?

	- Keri, don’t kid yourself. That goes for your dad, too. - Shovel sometimes tried to mentor her reckless young soul, and occasionally, he pulled it off.

	She huffed and reached for the intercom’s off switch when the speaker sparked to life again:

	- Don’t do that. Just tell me what you found. I’m not hiking over there.

	Keri described it in detail. The object was an urn for cremated remains, common enough these days, but not quite ordinary. First, the shape—those weird, upward-pointing handles, sharp enough to cut, right over the opening. Second, the patterns. Urns were usually plain, maybe sporting a family crest or corporate logo at most. This one had neither, yet its design seemed to pull you in, sharpening your focus. As Keri talked, she got a bit worked up, sweat beading on her forehead. No clear reason why, so she wiped it off with her sleeve, accidentally brushing the handle’s edge. Her jumpsuit tore easily, exposing her taut skin.

	- Shit! I just patched this!

	- What’re you on about?

	- Never mind, forget it. Just say something about this thing.

	- Hmm… I’d love to, but I’m stumped. Even in my line of work, I come across stuff I don’t recognize. As for price, like I said, don’t get your hopes up. I’d give it fifty credits, tops, but maybe it could fetch more. It’s an odd urn, after all.

	As Shovel spoke, Keri stared at the urn. The patterns started to dance and weave more than before, and the red dot began to pulse. Her eyes widened slightly, locked on it, and the dot, almost grateful, throbbed in sync with her heartbeat, growing ever so slightly with each pulse. The golden lines weren’t just intertwining—they bulged, mimicking human veins. A pale pink wave rippled from the dot, and now the whole vessel seemed to pulse with Keri. Her neat mouth, lined with perfect white teeth, parted slightly. Her mind registered everything, but she couldn’t move, so mesmerizing was the sight. Suddenly, she did move—her right hand began to rise slowly. Shovel’s voice faded into the growing hum of the ventilation system—or maybe it wasn’t the vents. Keri didn’t care anymore; her will shrank, waiting for something thrilling yet horrifying. In a split second—or maybe an eternity—her palm reached the handle’s edge, and she recoiled in terror. She wasn’t controlling her hand; it was like it didn’t belong to her.

	“Keeeeri…” - she heard in her head. It wasn’t a voice, more like a guttural growl, but the word landed clear in her fading consciousness.

	The peak of her panic hit just as a slight prick stung her ring finger. It felt like release, like catharsis, but it wasn’t over.

	“Keeeeri…”

	A red bead of blood swelled at the prick, young and still innocent.

	“Keeeeri…” - Her face went glassy, her eyes clouded, and the now-heavy drop broke free with a loud snap, drifting slowly toward the vessel’s center, glinting under the instrument lights.

	The moment the drop vanished into the urn’s depths, the steady hum stopped abruptly, and Shovel’s voice blared insistently from the speaker.

	- Keri! What the hell’s wrong with you?

	She flinched, and the spell started to fade fast.

	- Yeah… I’m fine… - Her voice wavered uncertainly. But nothing was fine, Keri thought. “What the fuck?” pounded in her head as the experience melted like the vapor from her cabin’s sliding doors. There stood Gabriel, his face blank, eyes sunken and still. It was unclear how long he’d been there.

	- Gabe, you need something?

	- Uh… Nothing… - His voice was hardly confident either. He turned and shuffled off.

	- Shovel, I’m beat… Signing off.

	- Sure, rest up, - Shovel said gently, and the line went dead.

	Keri glanced at the urn again. It looked about the same as when she first saw it. But something subtle had changed. Maybe the pattern shifted, or the lines reddened slightly. Not waiting for a repeat, she grabbed it and shoved it into a cabinet, slamming the door. She tried to stand but wobbled on the first try, then staggered to her bunk on shaky legs. Collapsing without undressing, she realized how exhausted and rattled she was the moment her head hit the pillow. That red planet wouldn’t leave her mind, morphing into the urn’s dot and her blood drop, merging into one pulsing red blot. Keri didn’t notice when she slipped into a restless sleep. She dreamed of her cabin, the urn at its center, a long black shadow stretching from it, growing wider, swallowing everything. When it consumed all, only Keri and the urn remained. And something else. That something grinned wickedly, tearing through space and sending shivers down her spine. On the horizon, the red planet rose, and the ship’s engines, despite the vacuum, sang, blending into a horrifying symphony, a hymn heralding something awe-inspiring in its unbearability. The ship soared, its engine trails weaving, connecting the twinkling stars into a complex pattern centered on the planet.

	Waking up, Keri remembered only the terrifying images, and a gnawing anxiety pulsed in her chest.
